I just stumbled upon this partly by accident
I had wanted to do some work on roating layers of grids (for moir√©) but then tryed out the trails & saw some potential
I was actually just trying to improve my technique for drawing a grid & needed a simple sketch to experiment
I then also started looking into scaling & rotating
Then using the cycling angle to calculate some other values (after initially messing around with mouseX)

The potential would seem to lie in the ratios of frequencies between the various driving waveforms.
